Using DBMail with Exim4
by Thomas Mueller
=======================

1.	Prerequisites
	
	* A Exim installation
	* A DBMail installation

2.	Generic

	LOCAL_DELIVERY=transport_dbmail

	Every router with local mail has to use 'transport = LOCAL_DELIVERY' then.

3. 	dbmail-smtp

	# transport using pipe
	transport_dbmail:  
		driver = pipe
		command = "/usr/local/sbin/dbmail-smtp -d $local_part@$domain"
		return_fail_output
		user = dbmail

3. 	dbmail-lmtp
	
	# transport using lmtp; exim and dbmail on the same host
	transport_dbmail:
		driver = smtp
		protocol = lmtp
		hosts = localhost
		allow_localhost
		return_path_add

	LMTP requires lmtp entries in /etc/services (they are not there in Debian!).

	lmtp 24/tcp
	lmtp 24/udp
