	but by mistake it wasn't changed in the definition.

2004-05-04  Aaron Stone  <aaron@serendipity.cx>

	* pipe.c (store_message_temp): the ring buffer now only looks
	for \n.\r\n, as some messages are in an "\n-only" format.

	* db.c (db_check_quotum_used): changed query so it also returns 1 if
	over quotum on PostgreSQL (and Oracle). Added db_free_result() to

	full names of mailboxes. 

2004-04-08  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* pipe.c (insert_messages): now does an extra check. If a recipient is bound
	to be labelled with TEMP_FAIL, a final check is made to check if perhaps we
	only need to forward the messages to another server. If this is the case,
	it gets the DSN_CLASS_OK label.

	* auth/authsql.c (auth_user_exists): removed use of

	clear the escaped_query string before using it.

	* dbsearch.c (db_search_range): corrected query to use physmessage

	was provided by Paul J Stevens.

2004-04-02  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* mysql/dbmysql.c (db_get_length): uses mysql_data_seek() directly
	again, without trying to do smart things which should be resolved

	again, without trying to do smart things which should be resolved
	by the library. 
	(db_query): now always calls mysql_store_result(). This will result

2004-03-31  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* db.c (db_findmailbox_by_regex): now calls regfree() to free the 
	possibly allocated memory in the preg regex struct. This fixes a 
	memory leak

	name from db_get_result() before freeing the result set. This should
	fix some crashes.

2004-03-22  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* db.c (db_imap_append_msg): use db_insert_message_block_physmessage()
	instead of db_insert_message_block()
	(db_imap_append_msg): now uses db_message_set_unique_id instead

	rfcsize of a physmessage.
	(db_update_message): uses db_physmessage_set_sizes

	* imapcommands.c (_ic_list): change to how regex patterns are

	file stream coming from a client.

	* lmtp.c (lmtp): messages with headers that are bigger than 
	READ_BLOCK_SIZE are rejected. Some changes were made to make sure
	that we don't get anymore data from the client before sending 
	a message indicating the failure.

	* main.c (main): now rejects headers that are bigger than READ_BLOCK_SIZE.
	This lets dbmail-smtp fail with a "data format error".

	were not properly initialised, because they were not set to 
	contain only '\0's, which was problematic for messages containing
	an empty body.

2004-03-16  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* dbmsgbuf.c (db_dump_range): now only adds '\r' to every line
	if no preceeding '\r' has been found before the '\n'.

	* mime.c: removed mime_list() function because it was unused.
	(mime_readheader): now deals correctly with messages that
	have '\r\n' instead of '\n' as end of line markers.
	(is_end_of_header): function for signaling the end of a header

	* mime.h: removed mime_list() function because it was unused.

2004-03-15  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* mysql/dbmysql.c: added quotes around TO_DATE string

	* db.c (db_insert_physmessage_with_internal_date): removed the
	quotes that Aaron has just put in. They've moved to dbmysql.c to
	make sure PostgreSQL handling does not break.
	(db_send_message_lines): a db_get_length() call asked for the length
	of field 2 (3rd field), while there was only one field in the result
	set.

2004-03-14  Aaron Stone <aaron@serendipity.cx>

	* db.c: MySQL 4.0.14 or higher required for INSERT ... SELECT!

	db_check_quotum_used, eliminating three related queries.
	(db_check_quotum_used): added function to check, in just one
	query, if a user has a maxmail quotum and if a message of the
	specified size would exceed that quotum or not.
	(db_copymsg): rewritten to use the db_check_quotum_used function,
	and to use a single INSERT INTO ... SELECT FROM query, and to use
	the canonical create_unique_id function and rather than its own.
	(db_insert_physmessage_with_internal_date): fixed missing quotes.

	* dsn.c (dsnuser_free_list): added function to free a list
	containing dsnuser structures, followed by freeing the list itself.
	(dsnuser_worstcase_list): added function to find the worst
	delivery condition from a list of dsnusers.
	(dsnuser_worstcase_int): added function to find the worst
	delivery condition from three indicators: OK, TEMP, FAIL.

	* pipe.c (insert_messages): now uses the dsnuser_worstcase functions.

	* sort/sort.c (sort_and_deliver): return type is now dsn_class_t,
	which provides a better indicator of the success or failure of
	the delivery.

2004-03-12  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* acl.c (acl_get_acl): now correctly returns an ACL string with

2004-03-11  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* imapcommands.c (_ic_append): passes the internal date through
	to to db_imap_append_msg().
	(_ic_append): sets flags for messages if needed by calling
	db_set_msgflag()

	* db.c (db_imap_append_msg): according to the rfc, the recent flag
	of a message that is append using imap append should always be set.
	this is now taken care of. db_imap_append_msg() used to set the
	\seen flag to '1', but according to the rfc, this should not be done,
	so it's been removed.
	(db_insert_physmessage_with_internal_date): new function to insert
	physmessages with an internal date.
	(db_imap_append_msg): uses db_insert_physmessage_with_internal_date()
	if an internal date is supplied. Otherwise it just uses 
	db_insert_physmessage().

2004-03-10  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* maintenance.c (main): uses 0 for update_curmail_size.

	of db_removemailbox(). Uses 1 for update_curmail_size.
	(_ic_close): calls db_expunge() with the user_idnr
	(_ic_expunge):calls db_expunge() with the user_idnr

	* db.h (db_insert_message_with_physmessage): removed because not used.
	(db_removemailbox): removed because not used.

	the messages.
	(db_insert_message_with_physmessage): removed because not used.
	(db_removemailbox): removed because not used
	(db_delete_mailbox): added parameter update_curmail_size. If this
	parameter is non-zero, the curmail_size of the user has to be
	updated after removing the mailbox (or only emptying it).
	(db_empty_mailbox): uses db_delete_mailbox with 1 for 
	update_curmail_size.
	(db_rollback_insert): removed because not used
	(db_expunge): uses db_subtract_quotum_used to subtract from used quotum.
	has a new parameter. It now expects the user_idnr of the for whom the
	mailbox is expunged. This saves a new lookup of the mailbox owner.

2004-03-09  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* db.h: removed db_update_message_multiple()

	* sort/sort.c (sort_and_deliver): uses db_message_set_unique_id()
	to set the unique id of a message.

	* db.c (db_copymsg): does not compute the new quotum on a copy, but
	only adds the messagesize to the used quotum, which saves looking
	at all messagesize on every copy.
	(db_add_quotum_used): new functions: add a value to the current
	curmail_size of a user.
	(db_imap_append_msg): uses db_add_quotum_used instead of doing
	a complete recalculation of the used quotum.

	a complete recalculation of the used quotum.
	(db_message_set_unique_id): new function that only updates the

2004-03-08  Aaron Stone <aaron@serendipity.cx>

	* lmtp.c: improved compliance with RFC 2033, LMTP, in two key areas:
	proper replies to the DATA command and removal of failed recipients
	from the recipients list, to prevent reporting their failures twice.
	* lmtp.c: allow for zero length envelope senders, which is common
	practice for MTA's sending bounces and other error messages.
	* misc.c (find_bounded): a zero length bounded string is now returned
	as a pointer to a zero length string (exactly one nul character)
	rather than as a NULL pointer to a nonexistant string.

2004-03-06  Aaron Stone <aaron@serendipity.cx>

	* md5.h: removed an old hack that actually broke 32 bit assumptions
	by making wrong assumptions (they may have been correct circa 1993).
	* md5.c: added check for WORDS_BIGENDIAN, corresponding to the
	autoconf script, as a backup in case the system lacks endian.h.
	* configure.in: added AC_C_BIGENDIAN to test the host for endianness.

2004-03-05  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* auth/authsql.c (auth_check_user_ext): uses lower(alias) to find
	the alias. This makes sure that searching for aliases is always done
	case-insensitively.

2004-03-04  Aaron Stone <aaron@serendipity.cx>

	* pipe.c (resolve_deliveries): moved to dsn.c, renamed, not static.
	* dsn.c (dsnuser_resolve_list): newly relocated from pipe.c.
	* dsn.h: added enum types for dsn class, updated structs to match.
	* lmtp.c: modified the delivery resolution loop to first call
	dsnuser_resolve_list and then to directly check for DSN_STATUS_OK
	rather than less reliable heuristics.
	* lmtp.c: replaced clumsy pointer math with a call to find_bounded,
	thereby also fixing a crash bug and a memory leak both relating to
	malformatted "mail from" commands.
	* lmtp.c (lmtp_handle_connection): added calls to lmtp_reset to ensure
	that memory held in the session struct is freed/zeroed when finished.
	* main.c: added a call to dsnuser_resolve_list.

2004-03-03  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* db.c (db_get_msgdate): uses the date2char function to construct a 
	TO_CHAR (PostgreSQL) or DATE_FORMAT (MySQL) string. 
	(db_get_msginfo_range):  uses the date2char function to construct a 
	TO_CHAR (PostgreSQL) or DATE_FORMAT (MySQL) string. 
	(date2char_str): construct date formatter for use in queries. This
	will always output the same format of date
	(char2date_str): construct date formatter for use in queries. This
	will make the database always handle the same format of date.
	(db_insert_physmessage): inserts the CURRENT_TIMESTAMP instead of
	making the timestamp using libc() calls.

2004-03-02  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* sql/postgresql/migrate_from_1.x_to_2.0.pgsql: alter internal_date

	* sql/mysql/create_tables_innoDB.mysql: removed a comma after the
	last directive in a table.

	trace.

2004-02-24  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* pipe.c (store_message_temp): change made by Chingson Chen 
	<chingson@msquaretech.com> to also accept messages larger than 512 kB.
	patch was altered slightly by Ilja to make it really work :)

2004-02-02  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* db.c (db_getmailboxname): fixed bugs with strncpy's, which resulted
	in segfaults.

	the beginning of the function. The owner_idnr is now found using
	the db_get_mailbox_owner() function.
	(db_listmailboxchildren): now does a check to see if any mailboxes
	can be found instead of using db_get_result() without this check.

2004-01-28  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	shared_mailbox_access removed.

	* sql/mysql/create_tables.mysql: tables shared_mailbox and 
	shared_mailbox_access removed.

	* misc.c (mailbox_remove_namespace): new function which makes a 
	simple mailbox name from a mailbox name with namespace information 

	* db.c (db_createmailbox): uses the mailbox_remove_namespace() function
	to remove possible namespace information from the mailbox name.

	with strlen(query_result) instead of strlen(query_result) + 1

	* db.c (db_get_mailbox_owner): added function which can be used to get
	the user_idnr of the user owning the mailbox.

2004-01-23  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* imapcommands.c (_ic_store): checks ACLs. does different checks
	for the store of different flags. \Deleted needs 'd', \Seen needs 's'
	and other flags need 'w' permissions.
	(_ic_create): checks ACLs. Currently only checks acl of parent mailboxes.
	This should be enhanced by adding checks for namespaces when adding
	namespace stuff.

	* imap4.h (imap_store_flag_t): new enum to denote store flags.

	* db.c (db_list_mailboxes_by_regex): subscribed mailbox already looks
	at all mailboxes a user is subscribed to (probably it should only look
	at mailboxes the user has access to via ACL's!)
	(db_subscribe): uses the new subscription table.
	(db_unsubscribe): uses the new subscription table.
	(db_list_mailboxes_by_regex): updated to make sure it only looks at
	mailboxes the user has access to using ACLs. This makes for some
	very interesting, complex queries (Performance..?)

2004-01-21  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* imapcommands.c (_ic_select): uses ACLs
	(_ic_examine): uses ACLs

	* auth/authsql.c (auth_validate): use create_current_timestring
	to get timestring

	get timestring

	* dbmail.h: created the timestring_t typedef, which is used

2003-12-15  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* db.h (db_get_user_from_alias): removed function. It was not
	in use

	* db.c (db_get_main_header): added an ORDER BY clause to the 
	query getting the messageblocks. When this is omitted, no can 
	tell which block will come first, when, of course, the first
	block, with the headers, should come first. This gave nasty 
	behaviour on PostgreSQL, which did not always return the blocks 
	in the right order. This PostgreSQL behaviour is completely
	compliant with SQL by the way.
	(db_get_user_from_alias): removed function. It was not in use

2003-12-11  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* db.c (db_get_main_header): changed query to do away with an
	error generated by the wrong use of an aggregate function without
	a GROUP BY. Thanks to Thomas Mueller <dbmail@mueller.com> for
	reporting this bug

	* sql/postgresql/create_tables.pgsql: added is_subscribed to 
	shared_mailbox_acc. It was missing. Thanks to Thomas Mueller
	<dbmail@mueller.com> for reporting this bug.

	* mini-injector.c: removed
	
2003-12-01  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* db.c (db_imap_append_msg): fixed a bug. db_insert_result() asked
	for "physmessages_id" instead of "physmessage_id". Thanks to
	Thomas Mueller <dbmail@tmueller.com> for this fix.
	(db_calculate_quotum_all): added a column to group by in the
	query. "usr.currmail_size" has to be in here. In MySQL, this does
	not have to be here, but PostgreSQL demands it (and rightly so)
	Thanks to Thomas Mueller <dbmail@tmueller.com> for pointing
	out this problem.

2003-11-27  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* pgsql/dbpgsql.c (db_connect): the connectionstring now only has
	the port number in it if the user has explicitely given the port
	number in dbmail.conf

	(db_update_message): now uses db_update_physmessage
	(db_insert_message_block): now uses 
	db_insert_message_block_physmessage()

	* shared_mailbox.c (shared_mailbox_list_by_regex): same change as
	made by Alex Wheeler's patch to db_list_mailboxes_by_regex() in db.c

	* db.c (db_list_mailboxes_by_regex): patch by Alex Wheeler 
	<awheeler@royall.com>. If no mailboxes match the pattern, realloc would
	yield a NULL pointer. The function has been changed to return 0 when
	there is no matching mailbox. The patch has been changed slightly to
	also free the tmp-pointer before returning.
	(db_findmailbox_by_regex): now only calls my_free() on normal_mailboxes
	and shared_mailboxes if these are non-NULL.
	(db_findmailbox_by_regex): if no matching mailboxes are found, 0
	is returned, and *nchildren is set to 0.

	* mysql/dbmysql.c (db_get_result): patch by Alex Wheeler
	<awheeler@royall.com>. mysql_data_seek causes performance penalty. 
	Changed to use a mysql_fetch_row() instead of mysql_data_seek() when
	possible.
	(db_get_length): same patch by Alex Wheeler as db_get_result()

2003-11-20  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* imaputil.c (binary_search): bugfix. high could become a maxint-1 
	when high = mid-1 would be calculated if mid == 0.

2003-11-12  Ilja Booij  <ilja@ic-s.nl>

	* auth/authsql.c (auth_validate): changed interface of auth_validate
	to return int instead of u64_t. 

	* auth/authldap.c (auth_validate): changed interface of auth_validate
	to return int instead of u64_t.

	* imaputil.c (binary_search): changed function. The binary search did

	(_ic_login): changed call to auth_validate()
	(_ic_fetch): changed call to db_getrfcsize()
	(_ic_fetch): casted some variables to stop warnings. This probably a 
	bit error prone (as was the original code), so this should be fixed
	in the near future.

	* db.c (db_findmailbox): changed interface to return int instead of
	u64_t.
	(db_createsession): changed call to db_findmailbox()
	(db_insert_message): changed call to db_findmailbox()
	(db_get_rfcsize): changed interface. now returns int instead of u64_t
