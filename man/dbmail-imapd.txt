DBMAIL-IMAPD(8)
===============



NAME
----
       dbmail-imapd - provides access to the DBMail system to clients support-
       ing Internet Message Access Protocol,  IMAP4r1,  as  specified  in  RFC
       3501.

SYNOPSIS
--------
       dbmail-imapd [-f configfile] [-p pidfile] [-nvVh]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
       The  dbmail-imapd  daemon  is  a fully featured IMAP4r1 server. It will
       spawn into a number of default processes  as  set  in  the  dbmail.conf
       file.   These  processes  will  enable  full IMAP4r1 communication with
       clients.

OPTIONS
-------
       -f configfile
              Specify an alternate config  file.  The  daemons  are  currently
              hardcoded  to  use  /etc/dbmail.conf for their configs, and will
              halt if the config file cannot be found. Use the  -f  configfile
              option  to specify your system's preferred config file location.

       -p pidfile
              Specify an alternate pid file. The daemons are  currently  hard-
              coded  to  use /var/run/dbmail-<daemon> for their pid files, and
              will halt if the pid file cannot be written. Use the -p  pidfile
              option  to  place  the pid file in your system's preferred loca-
              tion.

       -n     No daemonize. The program remains attached to the  console  from
              which  it  was  started. This is quite useful for debugging when
              combined with the -v option.

       -v     Operate verbosely. For daemons, this may only be useful with the
              -n option which keeps the program bound to the console.  Some of
              the utilities in the DBMail suite can take two  -v's  for  extra
              verbosity.  Those  which  don't understand this convention won't
              complain about having the extra -v and will  simply  operate  at
              their normal verbosity.

       -V     Show the version and copyright, then exit.

       -h     Show a brief summary of options, then exit.


DIAGNOSTICS
-----------
       Errors  and  notifications  are  send to the trace output as set in the
       dbmail.conf file.

BUGS
----
       Since the RFC on IMAP4r1 is not very strict and  consequently  some  e-
       mail clients aren't either it's hard to make a fully compatible IMAP4r1
       server.  However dbmail-imapd is tested and found compatible with  most
       IMAP4r1  clients.  dbmail-imapd  will  also  have  future configuration
       options for specific client compatibility.
