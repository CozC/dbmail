DBMAIL-IMAPD(8)
===============


NAME
----
dbmail-imapd - provides access to the DBMail system to clients supporting
Internet Message Access Protocol, IMAP4r1, as specified in RFC
3501.

SYNOPSIS
--------
dbmail-imapd [-f configfile] [-p pidfile] [-nvVh]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The dbmail-imapd daemon is a fully featured IMAP4r1 server. It will
spawn into a number of default processes as set in the dbmail.conf
file. These processes will enable full IMAP4r1 communication with
clients.

OPTIONS
-------

-p pidfile::
  Specify an alternate pid file. The daemons are currently hardcoded
  to use /var/run/dbmail-<daemon> for their pid files, and
  will halt if the pid file cannot be written. Use the -p pidfile
  option to place the pid file in your system's preferred location.

-n::
  Don't daemonize and remain attached to stdin/stdout. This is most useful
  for starting DBMail from inetd.
