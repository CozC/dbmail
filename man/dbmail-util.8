.SH NAME
dbmail-util \- maintains the integrity and cleanliness of the DBMail datatables.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


dbmail\-util [\-actubpd] [\-l time] [\-yn] [\-qvVh] [\-f configFile]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


The dbmail\-util program does a global database cleanup and integrity check\&. All messages that are set for deletion will be marked for final deletion (status 3)\&. All message that are marked for final deletion will be cleared from the database\&. The integrity check will check for unconnected messageblocks, unconnected messages and unconnected mailboxes\&.


By default, the checks run in a read\-only mode, possibly prompting to make changes\&. Pass the \-n option to respond no to any prompts\&. Pass the \-y option to make read\-write changes, responding yes to any prompts\&.


As DBMail matures and new features are added, additional check modes will be added\&. In addition, more prompts may be added for different situations where changes need to be committed to the database\&. We recommend using the \-a option to run all checks and using the \-n and \-y options if you expect no prompts\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-a
Perform all checks listed below\&. This option will be kept up\-to\-date with additional checks available in future versions\&.

.TP
\-c
Clean up unlinked message entries\&.

.TP
\-t
Test for message integrity\&.

.TP
\-u
Null message check\&.

.TP
\-b
Check and rebuild the body/header/envelope cache tables\&.

.TP
\-d
Set DELETE status for messages flagged \\Deleted by IMAP or POP3\&.

.TP
\-p
Purge messages with DELETE status\&. To purge messages currently marked \\Deleted, run with the \-pd options twice\&. This is not recommended; it is better to leave a grace period for old messages before permanently wiping them from the database\&.

.TP
\-l time
Clear the IP log used for IMAP/POP\-before\-SMTP the time is specified as <hours>h<minutes>m (don't include the angle brackets, though!)\&.

.TP
\-n
Show the intended repairs without making any changes, i\&.e\&. no to all\&.

.TP
\-y
Perform all repair actions , i\&.e\&. yes to all\&.

.TP
\-i
Enter an interactive user management console in some future version where this feature is implemented\&. It is not currently available\&.

.SH "COMMON OPTIONS"

.TP
\-f configfile
Specify an alternate config file\&. The utilities are currently hardcoded to use /etc/dbmail\&.conf for their configs, and will halt if the config file cannot be found\&. Use the \-f configfile option to specify your system's preferred config file location\&.

.TP
\-q
Quietly skip interactive prompts and helpful status messages which would otherwise be printed to stdout\&. Use two \-q's to silence errors which would otherwise be printed to stderr\&.

.TP
\-v
Operate verbosely\&. Some of the utilities in the DBMail suite can take two \-v's for extra verbosity\&. Those which don't understand this convention won't complain about having the extra \-v and will simply operate at their normal verbosity\&.

.TP
\-V
Show the version and copyright, then exit\&.

.TP
\-h
Show a brief summary of options, then exit\&.
