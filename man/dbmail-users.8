.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBdbmail-users\fR program enables you to manage the \fBDBMail\fR users. 
It lets you add, delete and change users as well as show information about
a specific user or display a list of existing users. It also has the capability
of adding/removing separate aliases.

.SH MODE OPTIONS
.IP "\fB -a \fR user"
Add a user
.IP "\fB -d \fR user"
Delete a user
.IP "\fB -c \fR user"
Change details for a user
.IP "\fB -e \fR user"
Empty all mailboxes for a user
.IP "\fB -l \fR uspec"
List information for matching users
.IP "\fB -x \fR alias"
Create an external forwarding address

.% This will be supported in a future release:
.% .IP "\fB -i \fR"
.% Enter an interactive user management console.

.SH MINOR OPTIONS
.IP "\fB -w \fR passwd"
Specify user's password on the command line
.IP "\fB -W \fR [file]"
Read from a file or prompt for a user's password
.IP "\fB -p \fR pwtype"
Password type may be one of the following:
plaintext, crypt, md5-hash, md5-digest,
crypt-raw, md5-hash-raw, md5-digest-raw
.IP "\fB -P \fR [file]"
Pull encrypted password from the shadow file
.IP "\fB -u \fR user"
New username (only useful for -c, change)
.IP "\fB -g \fR cid"
Assign the user to a client group.
.IP "\fB -m \fR max"
Set the maximum mail quota in <bytes>B,
<kbytes>K, or <mbytes>M, default in bytes
If set to 0, there will be no limit.
.IP "\fB -s \fR alia.."
Adds a list of recipient aliases. An alias is an e-mail address that is being 
delivered to the \fBDBMail\fR mailsystem and should be delivered to this user.
.IP "\fB -S \fR alia.."
Removes a list of recipient aliases (wildcards supported)
.IP "\fB -t \fR fwds.."
Adds a list of deliver-to forwards
.IP "\fB -T \fR fwds.."
Removes a list of deliver-to forwards (wildcards supported)


.SH COMMON OPTIONS
.IP "\fB-f\fR configfile"
Specify an alternate config file. The utilities are currently hardcoded to use
/etc/dbmail.conf for their configs, and will halt if the config file
cannot be found. Use the \fB\-f\fR configfile option to specify your
system's preferred config file location.
.IP \fB-q\fR
Quietly skip interactive prompts and helpful status messages which
would otherwise be printed to \fIstdout\fR.  Use two \fB-q\fR's to
silence errors which would otherwise be printed to \fIstderr\fR.

.% will be supported in the future
.% .IP \fB-n\fR
.% Show the intended action but do not perform it, as though no to all.
.% .IP \fB-y\fR
.% Perform all proposed actions, as though yes to all.

.IP \fB-v\fR
Operate verbosely.
Some of the utilities in the DBMail suite can take two \fB-v\fR's
for extra verbosity. Those which don't understand this convention
won't complain about having the extra \fB-v\fR and will simply
operate at their normal verbosity.
.IP \fB-V\fR
Show the version and copyright, then exit.
.IP \fB-h\fR
Show a brief summary of options, then exit.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
