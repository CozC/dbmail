.SH "SYNOPSIS"
dbmail\-smtp [\-t headerfield] [\-d addresses] [\-u usernames] [\-m|\-M mailboxname] [\-r return path] [\-f configFile]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The dbmail\-smtp program inserts messages from the commandline or from any MTA into the DBMail mailsystem. The program reads from standard input.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 3n
\-t headerfield
Deliver messages to the recipient MIME header specified in headerfield. The default header to use is the "Delivered\-To:" header.
.TP 3n
\-d addresses\&...
Deliver messages to the recipients specified by addresses. This option is mostly used for delivery from an MTA. Seperate multiple addresses by spaces.
.TP 3n
\-u usernames\&...
Deliver messages straight to the given username. Seperate multiple usernames with spaces.
.TP 3n
\-m mailboxname
Deliver messages to mailbox mailboxname of the recipient. If this mailbox does not exist yet, it is created. Sieve scripts will be run normally, possibly altering the destination mailbox.
.TP 3n
\-M mailboxname
Deliver messages to mailbox mailboxname of the recipient. If this mailbox does not exist yet, it is created. Sieve scripts are not run. Permission checks are not performed for mailbox creation or message delivery.
.TP 3n
\-r returnpath
Set return path for bounces and other error reports to return path.
.SH "COMMON OPTIONS"
.TP 3n
\-f configfile
Specify an alternate config file. The utilities are currently hardcoded to use /etc/dbmail.conf for their configs, and will halt if the config file cannot be found. Use the \-f configfile option to specify your system's preferred config file location.
.TP 3n
\-q
Quietly skip interactive prompts and helpful status messages which would otherwise be printed to stdout. Use two \-q's to silence errors which would otherwise be printed to stderr.
.TP 3n
\-v
Operate verbosely. Some of the utilities in the DBMail suite can take two \-v's for extra verbosity. Those which don't understand this convention won't complain about having the extra \-v and will simply operate at their normal verbosity.
.TP 3n
\-V
Show the version and copyright, then exit.
.TP 3n
\-h
Show a brief summary of options, then exit.
