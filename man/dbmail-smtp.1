.SH "COMMON OPTIONS"
.PP
\-f configfile
.RS 3n
Specify an alternate config file. The utilities are currently hardcoded to use /etc/dbmail.conf for their configs, and will halt if the config file cannot be found. Use the \-f configfile option to specify your system's preferred config file location.
.RE
.PP
\-q
.RS 3n
Quietly skip interactive prompts and helpful status messages which would otherwise be printed to stdout. Use two \-q's to silence errors which would otherwise be printed to stderr.
.RE
.PP
\-v
.RS 3n
Operate verbosely. Some of the utilities in the DBMail suite can take two \-v's for extra verbosity. Those which don't understand this convention won't complain about having the extra \-v and will simply operate at their normal verbosity.
