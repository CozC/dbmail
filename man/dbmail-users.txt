DESCRIPTION
-----------
       The  dbmail-users  program  enables you to manage the DBMail users.  It
       lets you add, delete and change users as well as show information about
       a  specific  user  or display a list of existing users. It also has the
       capability of adding/removing separate aliases.

COMMON OPTIONS
--------------
       -f configfile
              Specify an alternate config file. The  utilities  are  currently
              hardcoded  to  use  /etc/dbmail.conf for their configs, and will
              halt if the config file cannot be found. Use the  -f  configfile
              option  to specify your system's preferred config file location.

       -q     Quietly skip interactive prompts  and  helpful  status  messages
              which  would  otherwise  be  printed to stdout.  Use two -q's to
              silence errors which would otherwise be printed to stderr.



       -v     Operate verbosely.  Some of the utilities in  the  DBMail  suite
              can  take two -v's for extra verbosity. Those which don't under-
              stand this convention won't complain about having the  extra  -v
              and will simply operate at their normal verbosity.

       -V     Show the version and copyright, then exit.

       -h     Show a brief summary of options, then exit.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------
       Errors  and  notifications  are  send to the trace output as set in the
       DBMail configfile.

BUGS
----
       No known bugs.
