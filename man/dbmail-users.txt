capability of adding/removing separate aliases.

-c  user::
  Change details for a user

-e  user::
  Empty all mailboxes for a user

-l  uspec::
  List information for matching users

-x  alias::
  Create an external forwarding address


MINOR OPTIONS

  Specify user's password on the command line

-W  [file]::

ALIASES
-------

When creating a new user account, you must either add an initial alias that
delivers to the account name, or make the account in the form
of a fully qualified email address. For example, the user named 'Baz' created
like this:

`    dbmail-users -a baz -p crypt -w psword`

will *not* actually receive any mail yet! You must be sure to add an alias:

`    dbmail-users -c baz -s baz@foodomain`

You may add multiple aliases by repeatedly calling the dbmail-users(8)
utility, or by calling it with a comma-separated list of aliases:

`    dbmail-users -c baz -s baz@foodomain,baz@bardomain`

Two catch-all modes are also supported, for domains and for local parts:

`    dbmail-users -a baz -s @bazdomain`
 
`    dbmail-users -a baz -s baz@`

The first example catches email addressed to any user @bazdomain and delivers it
to Baz's INBOX. The second example catches email addressed to baz@ any domain
and also delivers it to Baz's INBOX.

There is no support for delivering to a particular mailbox other than INBOX
via the aliases system. Please use a Sieve script to sort mail like this.


FORWARDS
--------

Incoming messages addressed to particular email addresses can be forwarded out
to outside email addresses, piped out to a command or piped out with an
mbox-style From line to a command. For example:

`    dbmail-users -x bar@domain -t bar@another.domain`
 
`    dbmail-users -x bar@domain -t "|/usr/sbin/superspamtrapper"`
 
`    dbmail-users -x bar@domain -t "!cat > /var/spool/mail/bar/whatever.mbox"`

Forwards can be removed using basic glob style pattern matching.  A ? means
"match zero or one of any character" and * means "match zero or more of any
character." For example:

`    dbmail-users -x bar@domain -t "*"`

will complete and totally remove the 'bar@domain' external alias and all of
its forwarding addresses and commands.
