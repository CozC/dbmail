DBMAIL-UTIL(8)
==============


NAME
----
       dbmail-util  -  maintains  the  integrity and cleanliness of the DBMail
       datatables.

SYNOPSIS
--------
       dbmail-util [-cturpd] [-l time] [-qvVh] [-f configFile]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
       The dbmail-util program does a global database  cleanup  and  integrity
       check.  All messages that are set for deletion will be marked for final
       deletion (status 3). All message that are  marked  for  final  deletion
       will  be  cleared from the database. The integrity check will check for
       unconnected messageblocks, unconnected messages and  unconnected  mail-
       boxes.

OPTIONS
-------
       -c     clean up unlinked message entries

       -t     test for message integrity

       -u     null message check

       -r     repair any integrity problems

       -p     purge messages have the DELETE status set

       -d     set DELETE status for deleted messages

       -l time
              clear the IP log used for IMAP/POP-before-SMTP the time is spec-
              ified as <hours>h<minutes>m (don't include the  angle  brackets,
              though)

       -i     Enter an interactive user management console.


COMMON OPTIONS
--------------
       -f configfile
              Specify  an  alternate  config file. The utilities are currently
              hardcoded to use /etc/dbmail.conf for their  configs,  and  will
              halt  if  the config file cannot be found. Use the -f configfile
              option to specify your system's preferred config file  location.

       -q     Quietly  skip  interactive  prompts  and helpful status messages
              which would otherwise be printed to stdout.   Use  two  -q's  to
              silence errors which would otherwise be printed to stderr.



       -v     Operate  verbosely.   Some  of the utilities in the DBMail suite
              can take two -v's for extra verbosity. Those which don't  under-
              stand  this  convention won't complain about having the extra -v
              and will simply operate at their normal verbosity.

       -V     Show the version and copyright, then exit.

       -h     Show a brief summary of options, then exit.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------
       Errors and notifications are send to the trace output  as  set  in  the
       dbmail.conf file.

BUGS
----
       No known bugs.
