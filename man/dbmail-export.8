.fi

.SH "COMMON OPTIONS"

.TP
\-f configfile
Specify an alternate config file\&. The utilities are currently hardcoded to use /etc/dbmail\&.conf for their configs, and will halt if the config file cannot be found\&. Use the \-f configfile option to specify your system's preferred config file location\&.

.TP
\-q
Quietly skip interactive prompts and helpful status messages which would otherwise be printed to stdout\&. Use two \-q's to silence errors which would otherwise be printed to stderr\&.

.TP
\-v
Operate verbosely\&. Some of the utilities in the DBMail suite can take two \-v's for extra verbosity\&. Those which don't understand this convention won't complain about having the extra \-v and will simply operate at their normal verbosity\&.

.TP
\-V
Show the version and copyright, then exit\&.

.TP
\-h
Show a brief summary of options, then exit\&.
