.SH NAME
dbmail-export \- export a mailbox from the DBMail mailsystem to mbox format.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.nf
dbmail\-export [\-u user] [\-m mailbox] [\-o outfile] [\-f configFile]
.fi

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.nf
The dbmail\-export program allows you to export a dbmail mailbox  to  an
mbox formatted mailbox\&.
.fi

.SH "OPTIONS"

.nf
\-u user
       specify the owner of the mailbox you want to export\&.
.fi

.nf
\-m mailbox
       specify the mailbox you want to export\&.
.fi

.nf
\-o outfile
       specify the file into which the exported mail will be saved\&.
.fi

.SH "COMMON OPTIONS"

.nf
\-f configfile
       Specify  an  alternate  config file\&. The utilities are currently
       hardcoded to use /etc/dbmail\&.conf for their  configs,  and  will
       halt  if  the config file cannot be found\&. Use the \-f configfile
       option to specify your system's preferred config file  location\&.
.fi

.nf
\-q     Quietly  skip  interactive  prompts  and helpful status messages
       which would otherwise be printed to stdout\&.   Use  two  \-q's  to
       silence errors which would otherwise be printed to stderr\&.
.fi

.nf
\-v     Operate  verbosely\&.   Some  of the utilities in the DBMail suite
       can take two \-v's for extra verbosity\&. Those which don't  under\-
       stand  this  convention won't complain about having the extra \-v
       and will simply operate at their normal verbosity\&.
.fi

.nf
\-V     Show the version and copyright, then exit\&.
.fi

.nf
\-h     Show a brief summary of options, then exit\&.
.fi

dbmail\&.conf file\&.

.SH "BUGS"

.nf

.fi

.SH "LICENSE"

.nf

tributed under the GPL\&.
