.SH "NAME"
dbmail\-export \- export a mailbox from the DBMail mailsystem to mbox format.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
dbmail\-export [\-dDr] [\-u user] [\-m mailbox] [\-s imap search] [\-o outfile|\-b basedir] [\-f configFile]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The dbmail\-export program allows you to export a DBMail mailbox to an mbox formatted mailbox.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-u user
.RS 3n
specify the owner of the mailbox you want to export, using wildcards ? and * to match one or none, or one or more characters in the username, respectively.
.RE
.PP
\-m mailbox
.RS 3n
specify the mailbox you want to export.
.RE
.PP
\-o outfile
.RS 3n
specify the file into which the exported mail will be saved.
.RE
.PP
\-b basedir
.RS 3n
specify the base directory into which the exported mailboxes will be saved.
.RE
.PP
\-s search
.RS 3n
use an IMAP SEARCH string to select messages (default: 1:*) for example, to export all messages received in May, use: "1:* SINCE 1\-May\-2007 BEFORE 1\-Jun\-2007"
.RE
.PP
\-d
.RS 3n
flag exported messages as \\\\Deleted (use dbmail\-util to expunge).
.RE
.PP
\-D
.RS 3n
set delete status on exported messages (user dbmail\-util to purge).
.RE
.PP
\-r
.RS 3n
export mailboxes recursively (default: true unless \-m option also specified).
.RE
.SH "COMMON OPTIONS"
.PP
\-f configfile
.RS 3n
Specify an alternate config file. The utilities are currently hardcoded to use /etc/dbmail.conf for their configs, and will halt if the config file cannot be found. Use the \-f configfile option to specify your system's preferred config file location.
.RE
.PP
\-q
.RS 3n
Quietly skip interactive prompts and helpful status messages which would otherwise be printed to stdout. Use two \-q's to silence errors which would otherwise be printed to stderr.
.RE
.PP
\-v
.RS 3n
Operate verbosely. Some of the utilities in the DBMail suite can take two \-v's for extra verbosity. Those which don't understand this convention won't complain about having the extra \-v and will simply operate at their normal verbosity.
.RE
.PP
\-V
.RS 3n
Show the version and copyright, then exit.
.RE
.PP
\-h
.RS 3n
Show a brief summary of options, then exit.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
To export and delete all messages belonging to user \fIJoe\fR in mailbox \fIInbox\fR more than 30 days old, try this command:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
dbmail\-export \-u joe \-m inbox \-o joesinbox.mbox \-d \-s "1:* BEFORE `date '+%e\-%b\-%Y' \-d '30 days ago'`"
.fi
.sp
.RE
Note the careful bash quoting and backticks calling the GNU date(1) command. GNU date(1) has excellent features for retrieving relative dates. If you are using a different shell, you may need different quotes. Descriptions of relative dates are not supported by BSD date(1).
.sp
To export all mailboxes named Spam for all users into individual directories following the pattern SpamDump/<username>/Spam, try this command:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
dbmail\-export \-u \\* \-m Spam \-b SpamDump
.fi
.sp
.RE
Note the backslash to prevent the shell from expanding the \fB, as we want that \fR to be passed into DBMail for expansion based on the internal user list.
.SH "BUGS"
If you experience inexplicable problems with DBMail, please report the issue to the [1]\&\fIDBMail Bug Tracker\fR.
