.SH "NAME"
dbmail\-export \- export a mailbox from the DBMail mailsystem to mbox format.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
dbmail\-export [\-dr] [\-u user] [\-m mailbox] [\-s imap search] [\-o outfile|\-b basedir] [\-f configFile]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The dbmail\-export program allows you to export a DBMail mailbox to an mbox formatted mailbox.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 3n
\-u user
specify the owner of the mailbox you want to export.
.TP 3n
\-m mailbox
specify the mailbox you want to export.
.TP 3n
\-o outfile
specify the file into which the exported mail will be saved.
.TP 3n
\-b basedir
specify the base directory into which the exported mailboxes will be saved.
.TP 3n
\-s search
use an IMAP SEARCH string to select messages (default: 1:*) for example, to export all messages received in May, use: "1:* SINCE 1\-May\-2007 BEFORE 1\-Jun\-2007"
.TP 3n
\-d
flag exported messages as \\\\Deleted (use dbmail\-util to expunge).
.TP 3n
\-r
export mailboxes recursively (default: true unless \-m option also specified).
.SH "COMMON OPTIONS"
.TP 3n
\-f configfile
Specify an alternate config file. The utilities are currently hardcoded to use /etc/dbmail.conf for their configs, and will halt if the config file cannot be found. Use the \-f configfile option to specify your system's preferred config file location.
.TP 3n
\-q
Quietly skip interactive prompts and helpful status messages which would otherwise be printed to stdout. Use two \-q's to silence errors which would otherwise be printed to stderr.
.TP 3n
\-v
Operate verbosely. Some of the utilities in the DBMail suite can take two \-v's for extra verbosity. Those which don't understand this convention won't complain about having the extra \-v and will simply operate at their normal verbosity.
.TP 3n
\-V
Show the version and copyright, then exit.
.TP 3n
\-h
Show a brief summary of options, then exit.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
To export and delete all messages belonging to user \fIJoe\fR in mailbox \fIInbox\fR more than 30 days old, try this command line:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
dbmail\-export \-u joe \-m inbox \-o textbox5 \-d \-s "1:* BEFORE `date '+%e\-%b\-%Y' \-d '30 days ago'`"
.fi
.sp
.RE
Note the careful bash quoting and backticks calling the GNU date(1) command. GNU date(1) has excellent features for retrieving relative dates. If you are using a different shell, you may need different quotes. Descriptions of relative dates are not supported by BSD date(1).
