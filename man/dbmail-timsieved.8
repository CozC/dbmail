.SH NAME
dbmail-timsieved \- speaks the Manage Sieve draft protocol, used for managing Sieve scripts for a user's email account.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


dbmail\-timsieved [\-f configfile] [\-p pidfile] [\-nvVh]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


The dbmail\-timsieved daemon will spawn child processes as specified in the dbmail\&.conf file\&. These processes listen, by default, on port 2000 of the localhost interface\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-p pidfile
Specify an alternate pid file\&. The daemons are currently hardcoded to use /var/run/dbmail\-<daemon> for their pid files, and will halt if the pid file cannot be written\&. Use the \-p pidfile option to place the pid file in your system's preferred location\&.

.TP
\-n
No daemonize\&. The program remains attached to the console from which it was started\&. This is quite useful for debugging when combined with the \-v option\&.

.SH "COMMON OPTIONS"

.TP
\-f configfile
Specify an alternate config file\&. The utilities are currently hardcoded to use /etc/dbmail\&.conf for their configs, and will halt if the config file cannot be found\&. Use the \-f configfile option to specify your system's preferred config file location\&.

.TP
\-q
Quietly skip interactive prompts and helpful status messages which would otherwise be printed to stdout\&. Use two \-q's to silence errors which would otherwise be printed to stderr\&.

.TP
\-v
Operate verbosely\&. Some of the utilities in the DBMail suite can take two \-v's for extra verbosity\&. Those which don't understand this convention won't complain about having the extra \-v and will simply operate at their normal verbosity\&.

.TP
\-V
Show the version and copyright, then exit\&.

.TP
\-h
Show a brief summary of options, then exit\&.
