.SH NAME
dbmail-timsieved \- receives messages from an MTA supporting the Lightweight Mail Transport Protocol, as specified in RFC 2033.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


\fIdbmail\-timsieved\fR [\-f configfile] [\-p pidfile] [\-nvVh]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


The dbmail\-timsieved(8) daemon will spawn child processes as specified in the dbmail\&.conf(5) file\&. These processes listen, by default, on port 2000 of the localhost interface\&. Mail Transfer Agents, MTA's such as Postfix and Exim, speak LMTP to their Mail Delivery Agents which receive and store messages\&. DBMail implements such a system using a database backend\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-f configfile
Specify an alternate config file\&. The daemons are currently hardcoded to use /etc/dbmail\&.conf for their configs, and will halt if the config file cannot be found\&. Use the \-f configfile option to specify your system's preferred config file location\&.

.TP
\-p pidfile
Specify an alternate pid file\&. The daemons are currently hardcoded to use /var/run/dbmail\-<daemon> for their pid files, and will halt if the pid file cannot be written\&. Use the \-p pidfile option to place the pid file in your system's preferred location\&.

.TP
\-n
No daemonize\&. The program remains attached to the console from which it was started\&. This is quite useful for debugging when combined with the \-v option\&.

.TP
\-v
Operate verbosely\&. For daemons, this may only be useful with the \-n option which keeps the program bound to the console\&. Some of the utilities in the DBMail suite can take two \-v's for extra verbosity\&. Those which don't understand this convention won't complain about having the extra \-v and will simply operate at their normal verbosity\&.

.TP
\-V
Show the version and copyright, then exit\&.

.TP
\-h
Show a brief summary of options, then exit\&.

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"


Errors and notifications are send to the trace output as set in dbmail\&.conf(5)\&.

.SH "BUGS"


Not all of the features recommended by RFC 2033 are implemented\&.

.SH "LICENSE"


DBMail and its components are (c) IC&S and distributed under the GPL\&.
