DBMAIL-EXPORT(8)
================


NAME
----
       dbmail-export  -  export  a  mailbox from the DBMail mailsystem to mbox
       format.

SYNOPSIS
--------
       dbmail-export [-u user] [-m mailbox] [-o outfile] [-f configFile]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
       The dbmail-export program allows you to export a dbmail mailbox  to  an
       mbox formatted mailbox.


OPTIONS
-------
       -u user
              specify the owner of the mailbox you want to export.

       -m mailbox
              specify the mailbox you want to export.

       -o outfile
              specify the file into which the exported mail will be saved.



COMMON OPTIONS
--------------
       -f configfile
              Specify  an  alternate  config file. The utilities are currently
              hardcoded to use /etc/dbmail.conf for their  configs,  and  will
              halt  if  the config file cannot be found. Use the -f configfile
              option to specify your system's preferred config file  location.

       -q     Quietly  skip  interactive  prompts  and helpful status messages
              which would otherwise be printed to stdout.   Use  two  -q's  to
              silence errors which would otherwise be printed to stderr.



       -v     Operate  verbosely.   Some  of the utilities in the DBMail suite
              can take two -v's for extra verbosity. Those which don't  under-
              stand  this  convention won't complain about having the extra -v
              and will simply operate at their normal verbosity.

       -V     Show the version and copyright, then exit.

       -h     Show a brief summary of options, then exit.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------
       Errors and notifications are send to the trace output  as  set  in  the
       dbmail.conf file.

BUGS
----
       No known bugs.
