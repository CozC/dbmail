-----------
The dbmail-export program allows you to export a DBMail mailbox to an
mbox formatted mailbox.

-u user::
  specify the owner of the mailbox you want to export.

-m mailbox::
  specify the mailbox you want to export.

-o outfile::
  specify the file into which the exported mail will be saved.

-b basedir::
  specify the base directory into which the exported mailboxes will be saved.

-s search::
  use an IMAP SEARCH string to select messages (default: 1:\*)
  for example, to export all messages received in May, use:

EXAMPLES
--------

To export and delete all messages belonging to user 'Joe' in mailbox 'Inbox'
more than 30 days old, try this command line:

    dbmail-export -u joe -m inbox -o textbox5 -d -s "1:* BEFORE `date '+%e-%b-%Y' -d '30 days ago'`"

Note the careful bash quoting and backticks calling the GNU date(1) command.
GNU date(1) has excellent features for retrieving relative dates. If you are
using a different shell, you may need different quotes. Descriptions of
relative dates are not supported by BSD date(1).
