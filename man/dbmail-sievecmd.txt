DBMAIL-SIEVECMD(8)
===================


NAME
----
dbmail-sievecmd - manipulates Sieve scripts in the DBMail database.

SYNOPSIS
--------
dbmail-sievecmd -u username [-l] [-a scriptname] [-d scriptname] [-i
scriptname file] [-r scriptname] [-f configfile] [-p pidfile] [-nvVh]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
DBMail stores Sieve scripts in a table in the DBMail database. These 
scripts are used to sort incoming mail for the email users. Each user
has their own script space and may upload scripts to the
dbmail-timsieved(8) daemon. The dbmail-sievecmd(8) utility provides
a convenient method for the system administrator to work with
Sieve scripts from the command line.

OPTIONS
-------

-u username::
Specify the user whose scripts we will be modifying.

-l::
List scripts belonging to user

-a scriptname::
Activates `scriptname`, deactivating all other scripts.

-d scriptname::
Deactivates `scriptname` if it was active.

-i scriptname file::
Creates a script called `scriptname` by importing `file`. If `file`
is - (dash), 'stdin' will be read.

-r scriptname::
Remove the named script. If the script was active, no script will
be active after it is deletion.

COMMON OPTIONS
--------------
-f configfile::
Specify an alternate config file. The daemons are currently
hardcoded to use /etc/dbmail.conf for their configs, and will halt if
the config file cannot be found. Use the -f configfile option to
specify your system's preferred config file location.

-p pidfile::
Specify an alternate pid file. The daemons are currently hardcoded
to use /var/run/dbmail-<daemon> for their pid files, and will halt
if the pid file cannot be written. Use the -p pidfile option to
place the pid file in your system's preferred location.

-n::
No daemonize. The program remains attached to the console from
which it was started. This is quite useful for debugging when
com bined with the -v option.

-v::
Operate verbosely. For daemons, this may only be useful with the -n
option which keeps the program bound to the console.  Some of the
utilities in the DBMail suite can take two -v's for extra verbosity.
Those which don't understand this convention won't complain
about having the extra -v and will simply operate at their normal
verbosity.

-V::
Show the version and copyright, then exit.

-h::
Show a brief summary of options, then exit.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------
Errors and notifications are send to the trace output as set in the
DBMail configfile.

BUGS
----
Not all of the features recommended by RFC 2033 are implemented.
