.TH "DBMAIL-POP3D" 8 "" "" ""
.SH NAME
dbmail-pop3d \- provides access to the DBMail system to client support- ing Post Office Protocol, POP3, as specified in RFC 1939.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.nf
dbmail\-pop3d [\-f configfile] [\-p pidfile] [\-nvVh]
.fi

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.nf
The dbmail\-pop3d daemon is a fully featured POP3 server\&. It will  spawn
into  a  number  of  default  processes as set in the dbmail\&.conf file\&.
These processes will enable full POP3 communication with clients\&.
.fi

.SH "OPTIONS"

.nf
\-f configfile
       Specify an alternate config  file\&.  The  daemons  are  currently
       hardcoded  to  use  /etc/dbmail\&.conf for their configs, and will
       halt if the config file cannot be found\&. Use the  \-f  configfile
       option  to specify your system's preferred config file location\&.
.fi

.nf
\-p pidfile
       Specify an alternate pid file\&. The daemons are  currently  hard\-
       coded  to  use /var/run/dbmail\-<daemon> for their pid files, and
       will halt if the pid file cannot be written\&. Use the \-p  pidfile
       option  to  place  the pid file in your system's preferred loca\-
       tion\&.
.fi

.nf
\-n     No daemonize\&. The program remains attached to the  console  from
       which  it  was  started\&. This is quite useful for debugging when
       combined with the \-v option\&.
.fi

.nf
\-v     Operate verbosely\&. For daemons, this may only be useful with the
       \-n option which keeps the program bound to the console\&.  Some of
       the utilities in the DBMail suite can take two  \-v's  for  extra
       verbosity\&.  Those  which  don't understand this convention won't
       complain about having the extra \-v and will  simply  operate  at
       their normal verbosity\&.
.fi

.nf
\-V     Show the version and copyright, then exit\&.
.fi

.nf
\-h     Show a brief summary of options, then exit\&.
.fi

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"

.nf
Errors  and  notifications  are  send to the trace output as set in the
dbmail\&.conf file\&.
.fi

.SH "BUGS"

.nf
Plans are to add some more authentication schemes\&.
.fi

.SH "LICENSE"

.nf
DBMail and its components are (c) IC&S and distributed under the GPL\&.
