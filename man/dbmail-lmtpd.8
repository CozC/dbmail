.SH NAME
dbmail-lmtpd \- receive messages from an MTA supporting the Lightweight Mail Transport Protocol, as specified in RFC 2033.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.nf
dbmail\-lmtpd [\-f configfile] [\-p pidfile] [\-nvVh]
.fi

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.nf
The dbmail\-lmtpd daemon will spawn child processes as specified in  the
dbmail\&.conf file\&. These processes listen, by default, on port 24 of the
localhost interface\&. Mail Transfer Agents, MTA's such  as  Postfix  and
Exim,  speak LMTP to their Mail Delivery Agents which receive and store
messages\&. DBMail implements such a system using a database backend\&.
.fi

.SH "OPTIONS"

.nf
\-f configfile
       Specify an alternate config  file\&.  The  daemons  are  currently
       hardcoded  to  use  /etc/dbmail\&.conf for their configs, and will
       halt if the config file cannot be found\&. Use the  \-f  configfile
       option  to specify your system's preferred config file location\&.
.fi

.nf
\-p pidfile
       Specify an alternate pid file\&. The daemons are  currently  hard\-
       coded  to  use /var/run/dbmail\-<daemon> for their pid files, and
       will halt if the pid file cannot be written\&. Use the \-p  pidfile
       option  to  place  the pid file in your system's preferred loca\-
       tion\&.
.fi

.nf
\-n     No daemonize\&. The program remains attached to the  console  from
       which  it  was  started\&. This is quite useful for debugging when
       combined with the \-v option\&.
.fi

.nf
\-v     Operate verbosely\&. For daemons, this may only be useful with the
       \-n option which keeps the program bound to the console\&.  Some of
       the utilities in the DBMail suite can take two  \-v's  for  extra
       verbosity\&.  Those  which  don't understand this convention won't
       complain about having the extra \-v and will  simply  operate  at
       their normal verbosity\&.
.fi

.nf
\-V     Show the version and copyright, then exit\&.
.fi

.nf
\-h     Show a brief summary of options, then exit\&.
.fi

.SH "COMMON OPTIONS"

.TP
\-f configfile
Specify an alternate config file\&. The utilities are currently hardcoded to use /etc/dbmail\&.conf for their configs, and will halt if the config file cannot be found\&. Use the \-f configfile option to specify your system's preferred config file location\&.

.TP
\-q
Quietly skip interactive prompts and helpful status messages which would otherwise be printed to stdout\&. Use two \-q's to silence errors which would otherwise be printed to stderr\&.

.TP
\-v
Operate verbosely\&. Some of the utilities in the DBMail suite can take two \-v's for extra verbosity\&. Those which don't understand this convention won't complain about having the extra \-v and will simply operate at their normal verbosity\&.

.TP
\-V
Show the version and copyright, then exit\&.

.TP
\-h
Show a brief summary of options, then exit\&.
