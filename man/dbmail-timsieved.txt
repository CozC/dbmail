DBMAIL-TIMSIEVED(1)
===================


NAME
----
       dbmail-timsieved receives messages from an MTA supporting the Light-
       weight Mail Transport Protocol, as specified in RFC 2033.

SYNOPSIS
--------
       dbmail-timsieved [-f configfile] [-p pidfile] [-nvVh]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
       The dbmail-timsieved daemon will spawn child processes as specified in
       the dbmail.conf file. These processes listen, by default, on port 2000
       of the localhost interface. Mail Transfer Agents, MTA's such as Postfix
       and Exim, speak LMTP to their Mail Delivery Agents which receive and
       store messages. DBMail implements such a system using a database back-
       end.

OPTIONS
-------
       -f configfile
           Specify an alternate config file. The daemons are currently hard-
           coded to use /etc/dbmail.conf for their configs, and will halt if
           the config file cannot be found. Use the -f configfile option to
           specify your system's preferred config file location.

       -p pidfile
           Specify an alternate pid file. The daemons are currently hardcoded
           to use /var/run/dbmail-<daemon> for their pid files, and will halt
           if the pid file cannot be written. Use the -p pidfile option to
           place the pid file in your system's preferred location.

       -n  No daemonize. The program remains attached to the console from
           which it was started. This is quite useful for debugging when com-
           bined with the -v option.

       -v  Operate verbosely. For daemons, this may only be useful with the -n
           option which keeps the program bound to the console.  Some of the
           utilities in the DBMail suite can take two -v's for extra ver-
           bosity. Those which don't understand this convention won't complain
           about having the extra -v and will simply operate at their normal
           verbosity.

       -V  Show the version and copyright, then exit.

       -h  Show a brief summary of options, then exit.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------
       Errors and notifications are send to the trace output as set in the
       DBMail configfile.

BUGS
----
       Not all of the features recommended by RFC 2033 are implemented.
