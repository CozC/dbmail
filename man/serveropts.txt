OPTIONS
-------

-p pidfile::
  Specify an alternate pid file. The daemons are currently hardcoded
  to use /var/run/dbmail-<daemon> for their pid files, and will halt
  if the pid file cannot be written. Use the -p pidfile option to
  place the pid file in your system's preferred location.

-n::
  No daemonize. The program remains attached to the console from
  which it was started. This is quite useful for debugging when
  combined with the -v option.
