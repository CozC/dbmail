NAME
----

SYNOPSIS
--------
       dbmail-smtp [-t headerfield] [-d addresses] [-u usernames] [-m mailbox-
       name] [-r return path] [-f configFile]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
       The dbmail-smtp program inserts messages from the commandline  or  from
       any  MTA  into  the  DBMail mailsystem. The program reads from standard
       input.


OPTIONS
-------
       -t headerfield
              Deliver messages to the recipient MIME header specified in head-
              erfield.   The  default  header  to  use  is the "Delivered-To:"
              header.

       -d addresses...
              Deliver messages to the recipients specified by addresses.  This
              option is mostly used for delivery from an MTA.  Seperate multi-
              ple addresses by spaces.

       -u usernames...
              Deliver messages straight to a users  with  username  usernames.
              Seperate multiple usernames with spaces.

       -m mailboxname
              Deliver  messages  to  mailbox  mailboxname of the recipient. If
              this mailbox does not exist yet, it is created.

       -r returnpath
              Set return path for bounces and other error  reports  to  return
              path.

COMMON OPTIONS
--------------
       -f configfile
              Specify  an  alternate  config file. The utilities are currently
              hardcoded to use /etc/dbmail.conf for their  configs,  and  will
              halt  if  the config file cannot be found. Use the -f configfile
              option to specify your system's preferred config file  location.

       -q     Quietly  skip  interactive  prompts  and helpful status messages
              which would otherwise be printed to stdout.   Use  two  -q's  to
              silence errors which would otherwise be printed to stderr.

       -n     Show  the intended action but do not perform it, as though no to
              all.

       -y     Perform all proposed actions, as though yes to all.

       -v     Operate verbosely.  Some of the utilities in  the  DBMail  suite
              can  take two -v's for extra verbosity. Those which don't under-
              stand this convention won't complain about having the  extra  -v
              and will simply operate at their normal verbosity.

       -V     Show the version and copyright, then exit.

       -h     Show a brief summary of options, then exit.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------
       Errors  and  notifications  are  send to the trace output as set in the
       dbmail.conf file.
