.SH NAME
dbmail-sievecmd \- manipulates Sieve scripts in the DBMail database.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


dbmail\-sievecmd \-u username [\-l] [\-a scriptname] [\-d scriptname] [\-i scriptname file] [\-r scriptname] [\-f configfile] [\-p pidfile] [\-nvVh]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


DBMail stores Sieve scripts in a table in the DBMail database\&. These scripts are used to sort incoming mail for the email users\&. Each user has their own script space and may upload scripts to the dbmail\-timsieved(8) daemon\&. The dbmail\-sievecmd(8) utility provides a convenient method for the system administrator to work with Sieve scripts from the command line\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-u username
Specify the user whose scripts we will be modifying\&.

.TP
\-l
List scripts belonging to user

.TP
\-a scriptname
Activates scriptname, deactivating all other scripts\&.

.TP
\-d scriptname
Deactivates scriptname if it was active\&.

.TP
\-i scriptname file
Creates a script called scriptname by importing file\&. If file is \- (dash), \fIstdin\fR will be read\&.

.TP
\-r scriptname
Remove the named script\&. If the script was active, no script will be active after it is deletion\&.

.SH "COMMON OPTIONS"

.TP
\-f configfile
Specify an alternate config file\&. The utilities are currently hardcoded to use /etc/dbmail\&.conf for their configs, and will halt if the config file cannot be found\&. Use the \-f configfile option to specify your system's preferred config file location\&.

.TP
\-q
Quietly skip interactive prompts and helpful status messages which would otherwise be printed to stdout\&. Use two \-q's to silence errors which would otherwise be printed to stderr\&.

.TP
\-v
Operate verbosely\&. Some of the utilities in the DBMail suite can take two \-v's for extra verbosity\&. Those which don't understand this convention won't complain about having the extra \-v and will simply operate at their normal verbosity\&.

.TP
\-V
Show the version and copyright, then exit\&.

.TP
\-h
Show a brief summary of options, then exit\&.
