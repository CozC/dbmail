.SH "NAME"
dbmail\-sievecmd \- manipulates Sieve scripts in the DBMail database.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
DBMail stores Sieve scripts in a table in the DBMail database. These scripts are used to sort incoming mail for the email users. Each user has their own script space and may upload scripts to the dbmail\-timsieved(8) daemon. The dbmail\-sievecmd(8) utility provides a convenient method for the system administrator to work with Sieve scripts from the command line.

\-f configfile
.RS 3n
Specify an alternate config file. The utilities are currently hardcoded to use /etc/dbmail.conf for their configs, and will halt if the config file cannot be found. Use the \-f configfile option to specify your system's preferred config file location.
.RE
.PP
\-q
.RS 3n
Quietly skip interactive prompts and helpful status messages which would otherwise be printed to stdout. Use two \-q's to silence errors which would otherwise be printed to stderr.

\-v
.RS 3n
Operate verbosely. Some of the utilities in the DBMail suite can take two \-v's for extra verbosity. Those which don't understand this convention won't complain about having the extra \-v and will simply operate at their normal verbosity.
