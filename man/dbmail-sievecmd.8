.SH NAME
dbmail-sievecmd \- manipulates Sieve scripts in the DBMail database.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


dbmail\-sievecmd \-u username [\-l] [\-a scriptname] [\-d scriptname] [\-i scriptname file] [\-r scriptname] [\-f configfile] [\-p pidfile] [\-nvVh]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


DBMail stores Sieve scripts in a table in the DBMail database\&. These scripts are used to sort incoming mail for the email users\&. Each user has their own script space and may upload scripts to the dbmail\-timsieved(8) daemon\&. The dbmail\-sievecmd(8) utility provides a convenient method for the system administrator to work with Sieve scripts from the command line\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-u username
Specify the user whose scripts we will be modifying\&.

.TP
\-l
List scripts belonging to user

.TP
\-a scriptname
Activates scriptname, deactivating all other scripts\&.

.TP
\-d scriptname
Deactivates scriptname if it was active\&.

.TP
\-i scriptname file
Creates a script called scriptname by importing file\&. If file is \- (dash), \fIstdin\fR will be read\&.

.TP
\-r scriptname
Remove the named script\&. If the script was active, no script will be active after it is deletion\&.

.SH "COMMON OPTIONS"

.TP
\-f configfile
Specify an alternate config file\&. The daemons are currently hardcoded to use /etc/dbmail\&.conf for their configs, and will halt if the config file cannot be found\&. Use the \-f configfile option to specify your system's preferred config file location\&.

.TP
\-p pidfile
Specify an alternate pid file\&. The daemons are currently hardcoded to use /var/run/dbmail\-<daemon> for their pid files, and will halt if the pid file cannot be written\&. Use the \-p pidfile option to place the pid file in your system's preferred location\&.

.TP
\-n
No daemonize\&. The program remains attached to the console from which it was started\&. This is quite useful for debugging when com bined with the \-v option\&.

.TP
\-v
Operate verbosely\&. For daemons, this may only be useful with the \-n option which keeps the program bound to the console\&. Some of the utilities in the DBMail suite can take two \-v's for extra verbosity\&. Those which don't understand this convention won't complain about having the extra \-v and will simply operate at their normal verbosity\&.

.TP
\-V
Show the version and copyright, then exit\&.

.TP
\-h
Show a brief summary of options, then exit\&.

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"


Errors and notifications are send to the trace output as set in the DBMail configfile\&.

.SH "BUGS"


Not all of the features recommended by RFC 2033 are implemented\&.

.SH "LICENSE"


DBMail and its components are (c) IC&S and distributed under the GPL\&.
