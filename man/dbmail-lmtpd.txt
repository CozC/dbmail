DBMAIL-LMTPD(8)
===============


NAME
----
dbmail-lmtpd - receive messages from an MTA supporting the Lightweight
Mail Transport Protocol, as specified in RFC 2033.

SYNOPSIS
--------
dbmail-lmtpd [-f configfile] [-p pidfile] [-nvVh]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The dbmail-lmtpd daemon will spawn child processes as specified in the
dbmail.conf file. These processes listen, by default, on port 24 of the
localhost interface. Mail Transfer Agents, MTA's such as Postfix and
Exim, speak LMTP to their Mail Delivery Agents which receive and store
messages. DBMail implements such a system using a database backend.
