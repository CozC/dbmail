DBMAIL-LMTPD(8)
===============


NAME
----
       dbmail-lmtpd  - receive messages from an MTA supporting the Lightweight
       Mail Transport Protocol, as specified in RFC 2033.

SYNOPSIS
--------
       dbmail-lmtpd [-f configfile] [-p pidfile] [-nvVh]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
       The dbmail-lmtpd daemon will spawn child processes as specified in  the
       dbmail.conf file. These processes listen, by default, on port 24 of the
       localhost interface. Mail Transfer Agents, MTA's such  as  Postfix  and
       Exim,  speak LMTP to their Mail Delivery Agents which receive and store
       messages. DBMail implements such a system using a database backend.

OPTIONS
-------
       -f configfile
              Specify an alternate config  file.  The  daemons  are  currently
              hardcoded  to  use  /etc/dbmail.conf for their configs, and will
              halt if the config file cannot be found. Use the  -f  configfile
              option  to specify your system's preferred config file location.

       -p pidfile
              Specify an alternate pid file. The daemons are  currently  hard-
              coded  to  use /var/run/dbmail-<daemon> for their pid files, and
              will halt if the pid file cannot be written. Use the -p  pidfile
              option  to  place  the pid file in your system's preferred loca-
              tion.

       -n     No daemonize. The program remains attached to the  console  from
              which  it  was  started. This is quite useful for debugging when
              combined with the -v option.

       -v     Operate verbosely. For daemons, this may only be useful with the
              -n option which keeps the program bound to the console.  Some of
              the utilities in the DBMail suite can take two  -v's  for  extra
              verbosity.  Those  which  don't understand this convention won't
              complain about having the extra -v and will  simply  operate  at
              their normal verbosity.

       -V     Show the version and copyright, then exit.

       -h     Show a brief summary of options, then exit.


DIAGNOSTICS
-----------
       Errors  and  notifications  are  send to the trace output as set in the
       DBMail configfile.
