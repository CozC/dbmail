.SH NAME
dbmail-imapd \- provides access to the DBMail system to clients supporting Internet Message Access Protocol, IMAP4r1, as specified in RFC 3501.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


dbmail\-imapd [\-f configfile] [\-p pidfile] [\-nvVh]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


The dbmail\-imapd daemon is a fully featured IMAP4r1 server\&. It will spawn into a number of default processes as set in the dbmail\&.conf file\&. These processes will enable full IMAP4r1 communication with clients\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-p pidfile
Specify an alternate pid file\&. The daemons are currently hardcoded to use /var/run/dbmail\-<daemon> for their pid files, and will halt if the pid file cannot be written\&. Use the \-p pidfile option to place the pid file in your system's preferred location\&.

.TP
\-n
Don't daemonize and remain attached to stdin/stdout\&. This is most useful for starting DBMail from inetd\&.

.SH "COMMON OPTIONS"

.TP
\-f configfile
Specify an alternate config file\&. The utilities are currently hardcoded to use /etc/dbmail\&.conf for their configs, and will halt if the config file cannot be found\&. Use the \-f configfile option to specify your system's preferred config file location\&.

.TP
\-q
Quietly skip interactive prompts and helpful status messages which would otherwise be printed to stdout\&. Use two \-q's to silence errors which would otherwise be printed to stderr\&.

.TP
\-v
Operate verbosely\&. Some of the utilities in the DBMail suite can take two \-v's for extra verbosity\&. Those which don't understand this convention won't complain about having the extra \-v and will simply operate at their normal verbosity\&.

.TP
\-V
Show the version and copyright, then exit\&.

.TP
\-h
Show a brief summary of options, then exit\&.

.SH "EXAMPLE"

.IP
  # /etc/xinet\&.d/dbmail\-imap
  #
  service imap
  {
          socket_type     = stream
          wait            = no
          user            = root
          server          = /usr/local/sbin/dbmail\-imapd
          protocol        = tcp
          server_args     = \-n
          log_on_failure  += USERID
          disable         = no
  }
