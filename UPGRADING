Upgrading from DBMail 2.0 to DBMail 2.2

Dependencies

* Database: MySQL 4.1+ with innodb support, PostgreSQL 7.4+, or SQLite3
* Glib: (>= 2.8.0)
* GMime: (>= 2.1.19 or >= 2.2.0)
* Optional: libSieve (>= 2.2.1)
* Optional: LDAP such as OpenLDAP.

Config Changes

* [DBMAIL] section must have driver=mysql/pgsql and authdriver=sql/ldap.
* [DBMAIL] section now has two logging settings: trace_syslog and trace_stderr.
These replace the old TRACE_LEVEL setting.

Schema Changes

* Use the migrate_from_2.0_to_2.2 script, then run dbmail-util -by

Migration scripts from 1.2 to 2.0 and from 2.0 to 2.2 are provided in
sql/mysql and sql/postgresql. Please test them first before applying them
to your live database. Especially people who have modified their tables, and
users using databases that go back to 1.0 or earlier should take special care.

The schema for 2.2 adds a couple of new caching tables that will need to be 
filled before you can restart your daemons. For that use 'dbmail-util -by'. This
may run quite a long time depending on the size of your database.
