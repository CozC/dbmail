Upgrading from DBMail 2.0 to DBMail 2.2

Dependencies

* Database: MySQL 4.1+ with innodb support, PostgreSQL 7.4+, or SQLite3
* Glib: (>= 2.8.0)
* GMime: (>= 2.1.19 or >= 2.2.0)
* Optional: libSieve (>= 2.2.1)
* Optional: LDAP such as OpenLDAP.

Config Changes

* [DBMAIL] section 

 Dbmail allows you to select the database module and authentication module
 in the config file.

driver=mysql/pgsql/sqlite
authdriver=sql/ldap

 Some mail clients will send illegal 8bit headers. Dbmail will try to 
 decode these headers to make them readable. If you have clients that
 send 8bit headers (outlook office), set the next setting to charset 
 encoding that is most common amoung your users. Some examples: 
 windows-1250, latin-1, utf8.

default_msg_encoding=

 If your database is anything else than US_ASCII encoded please specify
 the encoding used in the next setting. 

encoding=

 the old TRACE_LEVEL was replaced by two new entries.

trace_syslog=
trace_stderr=

Schema Changes

* Use the migrate_from_2.0_to_2.2 script, then run dbmail-util -by

Migration scripts from 1.2 to 2.0 and from 2.0 to 2.2 are provided in
sql/mysql and sql/postgresql. Please test them first before applying them
to your live database. Especially people who have modified their tables, and
users using databases that go back to 1.0 or earlier should take special care.

The schema for 2.2 adds a couple of new caching tables that will need to be 
filled before you can restart your daemons. For that use 'dbmail-util -by'. This
may run quite a long time depending on the size of your database.
