DBmail extra's
==============

-	Dbmail can forward to external programs. 
	Create an alias. Set the deliver_to for that alias to:
	"|/usr/bin/procmail" will pipe the message for the alias to procmail
	"!/usr/bin/procmail" will do the same but add a mbox style header 
	You can also use this scan mail for certain users:
	"|/usr/bin/spamassasin | dbmail-smtp -d <username>"

-	DBmail supports pop and imap before smtp. This way you can authenticate your 
	users for a certain ammount of time to use the smtp server for relay.
	You'll have to create the pop/imap before smtp tables and enable 
	those services in the config file.
	After that you'll have to configure your MTA to read out that table 
	for allowing connections on those ip's.
